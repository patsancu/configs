## Important
Before linking the gitconfig file, add ssh keys to github. Otherwise, because of the gitconfig preferring ssh over http, nothing related to git<->github  will work.

## Further config
### Zsh / shell
If want to configure more stuff, create a file `~/.zshrc_extra` and source another file (or directly add stuff there)
### Spaceship
If want to config spaceship extra stuff, create a file `~/.extra-config.zsh` and source another file (or directly add stuff there)
